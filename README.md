# Bike-predection

Overview:
In the United States, various bike-sharing companies like Divvy, Zagster and Lime Bikes have gained prominence, offering cost-efficient and ecofriendly transportation options. This shift towards bike-sharing has led to an upsurge in demand for bicycles, but this demand isn't uniform across all regions. Managing the distribution of bikes effectively to meet demand
while maximizing profits poses a significant challenge for these
companies.
The key issue revolves around determining the optimal number of bikes to
place at different locations at various times to ensure both customer
satisfaction and profitability. Sometimes, potential riders may miss out on
bikes due to their unavailability, while in other instances, there may be an
excess of bikes in specific locations, leading to inefficiencies in resource
utilization.
Considering these challenges, it becomes crucial to develop strategies and
solutions to better understand and predict bike demand for different days
and scenarios. This not only enhances the user experience but also
contributes to the sustainability and success of bike-sharing programs in
the ever-evolving transportation landscape.


Objective:
The objective of this project is to leverage the power of data science,
machine learning, and deep learning to develop an effective demand
prediction system for bike rental companies.
By conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
implementing predictive models, our goal is to enable these companies to
proactively assess and meet the demand for bikes across various locations
and time intervals.
This predictive capability will not only optimize bike allocation but also
result in significant cost savings, ultimately ensuring that bike rental
services efficiently serve the needs of customers while maximizing
operational efficiency.
